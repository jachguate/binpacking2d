# binpacking2d

This is a simple, yet powerful **Delphi library** aimed to help people resolve binpacking 2D problems.

It borns as an exercise of the author and it currently only covers one use case, which is the accomodation of a number of _planes_ of the same size inside a larger plane, allowing guillotine cut while minimizing the paper waste, for the printing/press industry.

The engine can evolve to take into account other uses (wood, glass, continuous paper).

Please contribute back if you use and extend it.
