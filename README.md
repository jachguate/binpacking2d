# binpacking2d

This is a simple, yet powerful **Delphi library** aimed to help people resolve binpacking 2D problems.

It contains a engine capable of represent and accommodate rectangular planes inside a main rectangular plane in order to allow edge to edge (guillotine) cut while minimizing the waste of raw materials (paper, wood, glass).

It currently only covers the basic functionality for the printing/press industry which is the accomodation of a number of _planes_ of the same size inside a larger plane, allowing guillotine cut while minimizing the paper waste.

The engine can and eventually will evolve to take into account other uses (wood, glass, continuous paper).

Please contribute back if you use and extend it.
